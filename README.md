# luaide
IDE for the lua gods


# purpose 
> I started this project because I saw a gap in lua support when it comes to the lua programming language. Many text editors only provide syntax highlighting and code completions but not the ability to run a lua script by just clicking the run button. I know, you could be thinking "but why not add that feature to vs code or your prefered editor?". The answer is simple, I don't know how to write addons to vs code or any text editor for that matter. on the other hand I'm a good Java programmer so 1 + 1 = 1 0. Interprise language + skill = product that solves a problem. You may be fine with lua being treated as an embeddable scriptting language only but for some for us lua is more than just a language to embed on our c or c++ programs, It has became the goto language for leisure programming.

# Help needed

- [ ] Lua compilation and running
> * I am currently able to compile lua scripts and get the output, the only problem is that I wait for the process to finish and I also lose error reporting output from lua.

- [ ] Menu functions implementation 
> * I currently have many functions that are not implemented on the menu. such as copy/cut/paste.
